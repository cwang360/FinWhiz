# FinWhiz
Develop your understanding of finances with interactive visualizations!

Financial literacy is extremely important, yet many of us may not fully understand how insurance, loans, or the stock market work. We wanted to be able to provide clean, accurate visualizations for financial topics. FinWhiz is a website that allows users to see graphical data of financial topics, including stocks, insurance, and loans. In the stocks section, users can see visualizations of Monte Carlo simulations on their choice of stock and time period. This tool helps users better understand stock trends and make better decisions. Additionally, users can use the interactive loan graph to visualize loan payments with different loan options. The insurance page allows users to compare different insurance plans and how they could benefit from choosing one over another.

The bulk of the computation and graphing behind the project is done by custome Wolfram Alpha APIs.
